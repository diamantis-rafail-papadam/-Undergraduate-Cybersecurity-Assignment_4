# Technical University of Crete - HPY414 - Assignment 4
This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student in Technical University of Crete.

In the "Implementation.zip" file, you will find my implementation of AES encryption in ECB mode.

To test the program, follow these steps:
- Downloand and unzip "Implementation.zip".
- Go to the src directory.
- Run "make". You might get some warnings about deprecated functions that you can ignore.
- Follow the instructions in the README file to test the functionality of the program.
